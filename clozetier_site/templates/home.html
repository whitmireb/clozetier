        <p>Aiden looks like an extremely less buff version of Larry the Lobster</p>
        <p>Aiden insinuated that I stole his sandwich that I am allergic to.</p>
        <p>He will pay for this mockery</p>
        <p>His address is 111 Lake Hollingsworth Dr, Lakeland, FL</p>
        <p>He will sow what he has reaped at the expense of no one but himself</p>
        <p>I would sooner wrestle a hog in muck than stoop so low as to take from the likes of you</p>
        <p>You addle-pated, moon-calf! I wouldn’t touch your belongings if they were dipped in gold and wrapped in silk!</p>
        <p>A pox upon your forked tongue! I’d no sooner swipe from you than I’d borrow fleas from a mangy hound!</p>
        <p>If you weren’t as dim as a doused lantern, you’d see no thief would sully themselves with your tatty scraps!</p>
        <p>I wouldn't lower myself to steal from you, even if the crown jewels lay atop your addled head!</p>
        <p>If thievery were my trade, I’d steal from nobility, not some lout with a coin purse lighter than a feather!</p>
        <p>Had I wanted rubbish, I’d have gone to the town’s dung heap rather than raid your belongings</p>
        <p>Such nerve from a simpleton whose fortune couldn’t fill a thimble</p>
